JP Morgan Code for Good Hackathon Project
==============
This project, intended to serve as a blueprint to be built upon by full-time JP Morgan engineers, used NYC Open Data to create heat maps to show where various neighborhood complaints were most frequently registered. This is not a full back-up of the project, but includes some of my early Python code for it. 

The final project was written in JavaScript, and I contributed additionally to the CSS and integration of the Google Maps API.
